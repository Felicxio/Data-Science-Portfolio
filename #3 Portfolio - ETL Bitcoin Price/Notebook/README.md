# Bitcoin Price ETL & Dashboard (Databricks)

This project implements a simple ETL pipeline to collect, process, and visualize Bitcoin price data using Databricks, Python, APIs, and pandas.

The system periodically retrieves Bitcoin prices from a public API, converts values from USD to BRL, processes the data using pandas, and displays the results in an interactive dashboard.
